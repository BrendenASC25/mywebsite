    I’m a high school junior at the High School for Math, Science, and Engineering (HSMSE) who’s active in both my school and community. I’ve been part of the All Star Code Summer Intensive, learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript through hands-on projects. Outside of coding, I have volunteered as a technology support & equipment technician at my school, helping with tech setup, repairs, and troubleshooting.  I also have volunteered to curate drafting projects for discovery students at my school.<br><br>
    I’m involved in several student-led initiatives, including founding the SHSAT Tutoring Program to support middle schoolers, starting the Letters of Hope project to send encouragement to hospitalized children and veterans, and launching the Graduation Murals Legacy Project to strengthen school culture. I’m also a member of the National Honor Society and National German Honor Society.<br><br>
    Athletics are another key part of my life, I compete on my school’s Track & Field team, focusing on triple jump and sprints, and have placed in city-wide championships. My experiences across volunteering, leadership, athletics, and technology have helped me build teamwork, problem-solving, and adaptability skills that I bring to every project I work on.
